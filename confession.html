I have been in a relationship for lst 1 n half year…It all started when he( H****) proposed me,firstly I said no and we became friends after dat..
used 2 chat whole day long and shared everything with each other and after few months he asked me again and I agreed..He was d best guy any gal can have ,
extreme loving and caring but I was vry careless and casual in the relationship and used 2 fight on silly matters..he tried his level best at each n evry 
point 2 make it work and saved it always..He was damn serious and wanted 2 marry me but I treated him as an option(but I loved him a lot)..Till now evrythng
 was juzz lyk a fairy tale 4 me but tym changed he came 2 knw dat his father had cancer..He was broken bt still I dint realized anything 
and kept my ego and 
attitude above all..Due 2 some problems he had 2 leave his home and was left all alone and still I was at ma worst n never supported him...
Then after few months
 he lost his father..After that gradually our relation lost importance 2 him..He started avoiding ma msgs,calls,his behavior changed towards me …Finally he broke
 up with me few mnths ago… I apologized 2 him several tyms bt he doesn’t wanna listen nythng …I tried a lot 2 make him stay bt nothing worked..
Now he doesn’t even 
cares about me if I will even die…I dunno wat 2 do 2 make him realize dat I have changed… I still luv him and will luv 4 ever n cant even think of living without 
him…I know I am being punished for wat I did 2 him (# Karma) n I have faced evry single thing which I did 2 him earlier n now I realized how much he was hurt..
bt
 will it come 2 an end n everything wud be like before???"</pre>

I was in a relationship for more den 5 yrs .. But in the end my girl ditched me nd got engaged wit some odr guy (her dad's friends son) she dint
 even know him b4 but coz her parents had asked her to leave me and get married to him.. Her family dint like me so much and the only problem with
 me according to them was dat i am not dat well off.. But my girl always acted to me as if money dint mean anything to her.. 
I tried a lot to get her back but after a month i got to noe d real reason for breaking up .. Dat was she had always kept me as an option nd now
 dat she got a guy who is richer dan me she kicked me nd got paired up with him 

For the first six months i was in total depression but with the help of my parents and a few good frens i moved on a bit nd got lil normal.. Its 
been 1 n a half yrs since my breakup but still i am not able to forget her 
I still pray to god dat she always stays happy with him nd have a peaceful life.. And 1 thing i would like to say her ' M#*# i still love u a lot
 , evn though its been so long but i am still waiting for you, god bless u'</pre>

# today is my girls wedding..i dont have the courage to attend her marriage.i wish that she lives happily with him forever..but i will live long
 happily with her thoughts and yeah that was her final wish for me..just in an hour she will be mrs someone but my mind just keeps thinking of the
 moments we spent together and the million fake promises she made. I bet she loves me though she is engaged and swear yes what i said know is true
 even on bill gates..i am just holding her slam book,my eyes just glued to the line she has written 'WILL U MARRY ME ??' a silent drop of tear now 
i shed on that magical question just to remind me that i shouldnt fool myself reading it anymore. those times when i had icecream with her has now 
become my eyes dream!! its very hard to digest that my once better half is going to spend the next half of her life with him..!! It was she who taught
 what love is, the most beautiful times of my life were the once i dreamed about she being my wife is dead now, but i console myself everyday by pretending
 myself that she is unlucky though i know am unlucky..am typing this confession of mine with tears rolling down my eyes and saying yes to myself that i can 
win in life!! Wherever she is, years may roll on but if i miss her at any moment i will just touch my heart and say here she lives.
